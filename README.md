# Hulo Clone With Next.JS and Tailwind

Another clone from the Sonny Sangha series.

So the takeouts for this clone where:

- using forwardRef from react to pass a ref from a parent to a child components
- Interesiting use of the useRouter to push a query and then using that query to
  fetch a request and serve that as serversideprops. No component changes with
  diferent routes only data. Nice and clean approach.

This was a quick one. See you in the next one.
